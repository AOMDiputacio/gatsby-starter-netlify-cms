## The easy way to deploy

1. First login to your `Github` & `Netlify` account

2. Go to this link and start a gatsby netlify cms project:

https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms&stack=cms

3. Clone this project to your local machine

4. Unzip the given project

5. Replace with the cloned project (Actually, delete everything from the cloned project then paste unzipped project. The only folder you shouldn't delete is `.git`. Which is hidden by default and even if you select all and delete everything, normally this will not delete)

6. Then commit & push
